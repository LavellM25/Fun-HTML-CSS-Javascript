# 🧠 Project 2: Understanding `let`, `var`, and `const` in JavaScript

Welcome to **Project 2**, a hands-on HTML and JavaScript learning tool focused on one of the most important JavaScript fundamentals: variable declarations using `let`, `var`, and `const`.

This page visually and interactively explains how these keywords work differently when it comes to scope, reassignability, and redeclaration.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This project:

- Demonstrates the differences between `let`, `var`, and `const` in JavaScript.
- Prints variable behavior to the browser console for easy understanding.
- Includes commented code to walk through examples step-by-step.
- Explains variable scope (function vs. block), mutability, and common pitfalls.

---

## 🧠 Educational Tips

- Use `let` for variables that you plan to **reassign**, but not **redeclare**.
- Use `const` for **fixed values** that shouldn't be reassigned or redeclared.
- Avoid `var` in modern development unless maintaining legacy code — it can behave unexpectedly due to function scoping and lack of block scope.
- Open your browser’s **console** (`Right-click → Inspect → Console tab`) to follow along with the examples.

## ✅ HTML

- Introduces concepts using semantic HTML: `<h1>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>` sections.
- Uses ordered lists to explain key concepts visually on the web page.
- No styling (CSS) was added — the focus is on the *content* and *logic*.

## ⚙️ JavaScript

- Shows how `let`, `var`, and `const` are declared and used.
- Includes scenarios like:
  - Reassignment vs. redeclaration
  - Block scope vs. function scope
  - Variable visibility across functions
- Uses `console.log()` statements and detailed comments for teaching.
- Demonstrates scoping bugs with `var`, and how to avoid them using `let` and `const`.

---

## 📝 Future Ideas

- Add a visual toggle or buttons to let users run each block of code interactively.
- Include styled CSS cards to visually separate each explanation on the webpage.
- Embed a live code editor (e.g., CodeMirror or JSFiddle iframe) for live practice.
