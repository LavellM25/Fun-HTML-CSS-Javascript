# 🛫 Project 1: Intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Integration

Welcome to **Project 1**, a simple yet educational web page demonstrating the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project is designed as a beginner-friendly template for understanding how to link and style web elements, 
and how to manipulate them dynamically with JavaScript.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This project:

- Loads a basic web page with a header and a paragraph.
- Applies custom styles to the elements using external CSS.
- Uses JavaScript to dynamically update the text, font color, and background color of the elements after the page loads.

---

## 🧠 Educational Tips
- Always link your JavaScript at the bottom of the HTML body so it runs after the DOM is loaded.
- Use comments liberally in your JavaScript code to document learning and behavior.
- console.log() is a great way to test your ideas before affecting the page visually.
- getElementById() is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to target an element.

---

### ✅ HTML
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` structure
- Linking external styles and scripts
- Basic tags like `<h1>` and `<p>`

### 🎨 CSS
- Styling by element ID (`#header`, `#paragraph`)
- Use of fonts, background colors, text alignment, and font sizes

### ⚙️ JavaScript
- Using `console.log()` to print to the browser console
- DOM manipulation via `getElementById()`
- Changing text content and styling with JavaScript

---

## 📝 Future Ideas
- Add interactive buttons to trigger style changes.
- Use event listeners (e.g., onclick) to update content dynamically.
- Replace getElementById() with other selectors like querySelector() for more flexibility.
