# Assignment 1: Business Website Homepage

## 📖 Overview
This project is the first step in building a multi-page business website for the Study.com College Accelerator course. The assignment focuses on creating a homepage using **HTML5** and **CSS** that demonstrates proper structure, styling, and accessibility practices.

The homepage introduces a fictional (or real) business, provides a list of services, and sets up navigation to additional pages that will be developed in later assignments.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This assignment addresses the following course learning outcomes:

- Describe the purpose and structure of HTML and CSS in building webpages.
- Construct simple webpages using HTML to create content and CSS to style it.
- Apply web accessibility principles (semantic tags, alt text, labels).

---

## 📝 Requirements
The homepage must include:

- Proper **HTML5 structure** (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- A **business logo or placeholder image** displayed with `<img>` (with `alt` text).
- An **introduction paragraph** about the business using different HTML elements.
- A **list of services or features** using an unordered list `<ul>`.
- **Navigation links** to other pages (to be built in future assignments).
- **Simple CSS styling** for colors, fonts, and layout using CSS classes.

## 🛠️ File Structure
- index.html # Main homepage file
- style.css # Stylesheet with classes for layout, fonts, and colors
- images/ # Folder for logo or placeholder image
- README.md # Project documentation (this file)

---

## 🌐 Accessibility Considerations
- All images include meaningful `alt` text.
- Headings follow a logical hierarchy (`h1` for site title, `h2` for sections).
- Links use descriptive text (e.g., "About Us" instead of "Click here").
- Semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`) provide clear structure for screen readers.
